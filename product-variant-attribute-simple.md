totally—let’s make it super simple.

The simple rule
Attributes = specs (for filters/search).

Variants = choices (only when price or stock changes).

If a choice doesn’t change price or stock, don’t make a variant; keep it as a spec.

Minimal data model (2 tables, both with JSON)
products

id, name

attributes (JSON) → specs for filtering (brand, CPU, battery…)

images (array)

variants

id, product_id, sku

options (JSON) → what the shopper chooses (Color, Storage, RAM…)

price, stock, image

That’s it.

How the page works (simple)
Show specs from products.attributes.

Build option dropdowns from what’s in variants.options (e.g., Color, Storage).

When the user picks options, find the matching variant by options → show price/stock/image.

Category filters use attributes only.

When to add a variant (cheatsheet)
Storage/RAM/Color that changes price or stock → variant

Carrier lock, keyboard layout, pack size (if stocked separately) → variant

CPU model, ports, battery, weight, IP rating, codecs → attributes (no variants)
